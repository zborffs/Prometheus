Prometheus 0.1 played Vice 1.1 in 10 games at 1000 ms time control orchestrated by c-chess-cli on MacBook Pro (personal)

Command Run:
```
./c-chess-cli -games 10 -each movetime=1.0 -engine cmd=../../cmake-build-debug-sse/prometheus -engine cmd=../../../Chess/Vice_poly/Source/vice -pgn out.pgn 3 -log
```

Prometheus (win-lose-draw) = (0-9-1)
LOS 0.05 -> Very likely not as good
