Objectives
----------
- Determine the ELO to get the relative skill of each engine by playing 200-300 games each at kinda fast time controls
    - Orchestrate tournament between three "worst" engines (mine, vice, and Spartan)
    - Compute the ELO of each engine
    - Compute the LOS of each engine w.r.t each other engine
    - Save the ELO and LOS information somewhere, have Julia visualize it
- Run the Bratko-

```
./c-chess-cli -games 600 -each movetime=1.0 -engine cmd=../../cmake-build-debug-sse/prometheus -engine cmd=./Spartan -engine cmd=./vice -pgn ../data/Regression_00/tournament.pgn 3
```
